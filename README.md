# LED-Control-Project-Custom-Startup-and-Linker-Script

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to turn on a LED using a custom startup file and linker script. By writing your own initialization routines and configuring the memory layout, you gain fine-grained control over the hardware and software aspects of the application.

## Features

- Turn on a LED connected to an embedded board.
- Custom startup file to initialize the microcontroller's core and peripherals.
- Linker script for defining memory regions and organizing code and data sections.
